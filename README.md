# Velocity Chess

This was my first project written in C++, and my first chess engine.

This project requires SFML to compile.

I have only tried running this project on macOS though I see no reason why it wouldn't run on other platforms.

To use, type `gui` in the command line where the compiled binary was run, a GUI should open up where you can play against the computer.
