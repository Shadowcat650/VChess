# Velocity Chess

This was my first project written in C++, and my first chess engine.

This project requires the SFML library to compile.

I have only tried running this project on macOS. It will require some changes to run on other platforms.

To use, type `gui` in the command line where the compiled binary was run, a GUI should open up where you can play against the computer.


# optimization branch

This branch is where I will be optimizing velocity chess.

I will merge it into main when complete.
